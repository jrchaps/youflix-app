This SPA uses the Youtube API to allow the user to search for Youtube videos and watch them. This is inspired by UI of Netflix's desktop site.
I wrote javascript and CSS to try to replicate the behavior, and I think I got pretty close, although it no doubt could be improved (especially the hover behavior).

Technologies used: React, Redux, React-Router, styled-components, create-react-app.
